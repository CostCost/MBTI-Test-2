<P>
<p>
As an ESFP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you take
things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.  Your
secondary mode is internal, where you deal with things according to how you
feel about them, or how they fit with your personal value system.
<p>
ESFPs live in the world of people possibilties.  They love people and new
experiences.  They are lively and fun, and enjoy being the center of 
attention.  They live in the here-and-now, and relish excitement and drama
in their lives.
<p>
ESFPs have very strong inter-personal skills, and may find themselves in the
role of the peacemaker frequently.  Since they make decisions by using 
their personal values, they are usually very sympathetic and concerned
for other people's well-being.  They're usually quite generous
and warm.  They are very observant about other people, and seem to sense
what is wrong with someone before others might, responding warmly with 
a solution to a practical need.  They might not be the best advice-givers
in the world, because they dislike theory and future-planning, but they 
are great for giving practical care.
<p>
ESFP is definitely a spontaneous, optimistic individual.  They love to have fun.
If the ESFP has not developed their Thinking side by giving consideration to
rational thought processing, they tend to become over-indulgent, and place
more importance on immediate sensation and gratification than on their
duties and obligations.  They may also avoid looking at long-term consequences
of their actions.
<p>
For the ESFP, the entire world is a stage.  They love to be the center
of attention and perform for people.  They're constantly putting on a show
for others to entertain them and make them happy. 
They enjoy stimulating other people's senses,
and are extremely good at it.  They would love nothing more than for life to
be a continual party, in which they play the role of the fun-loving host.
<p>
ESFPs love people, and everybody loves an ESFP.  One of their greatest
gifts is their general acceptance of everyone.  They are upbeat and enthusiastic,
and genuinely like almost everybody.  
An ESFP is unfailingly warm and generous with their friends, and they generally
treat everyone as a friend.  However, once crosesed, an ESFP is likely to make
a very strong and stubborn judgment against the person who crossed them.
They are capable of deep dislike in such a situation.
<p>
The ESFP under a great deal of stress gets overwhelmed with negatives thoughts
and possibilities.  As an optimistic individual who lives in the world of
possibilities, negative possibilities do not sit well with them.  In an 
effort to combat these thoughts, they're likely to come up with simple, global
statements to explain away the problem.  These simplistic explanations may or
may not truly get to the nature of the issue, but they serve the ESFP well
by allowing them to get over it.
<p>
ESFPs are likely to be very practical, although they hate structure and routine.
They like to "go with the flow", trusting in their ability to improvise in
any situation presented to them.  They learn best with "hands-on" experience,
rather than by studying a book.  They're uncomfortable with theory.  If
an ESFP hasn't developed their intuitive side, they may tend to avoid situations
which involve a lot of theoretical thinking, or which are complex and
ambiguous.  For this reason, an ESFP may have difficulty in school.  On the
other hand, the ESFP does extremely well in situations where they're allowed
to learn by interacting with others, or in which they "learn by doing".
<p>
ESFPs have a very well-developed appreciation for aesthetic beauty, and
an excellent sense of space and function.  If they have the means, they're
likely to have to have many beautiful possessions, and an artfully furnished
home.  In general, they take great pleasure in objects of aesthetic beauty.
They're likely to have a strong appreciation for the finer things in life,
such as good food and good wine.
<p>
The ESFP is a great team player.  He or she is not likely to create any problems
or fuss, and is likely to create the most fun environment possible for
getting the task done.  ESFPs will do best in careers in which they are
able to use their excellent people skills, along with their abilities to
meld ideas into structured formats.  Since they are fast-paced individuals
who like new experiences, they should choose careers which offer or require
a lot of  diversity, as well as people skills.
<p>
ESFPs usually like to feel strongly bonded with other people, and
have a connection with animals and small children that is not found in
most other types.  They're likely to have a strong appreciation for
the beauties of nature as well.
<p>
The ESFP has a tremendous love for life, and knows how to have fun.  They 
like to bring others along on their fun-rides, and are typically a lot of
fun to be with.  They're flexible, adaptable, genuinely interested in
people, and usually kind-hearted.  They have a special ability to get a lot
of fun out of life, but they need to watch out for the pitfalls associated with
living entirely in the moment.
