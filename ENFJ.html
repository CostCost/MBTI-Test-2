<p align="left">
As an ENFJ, you're primary mode of living is focused externally, where you 
deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit
into your personal value system.  Your secondary mode is internal, where
you take things in primarily via your intuition.
<p align="left">
ENFJs are people-focused individuals.  They live in the world of people
possibilities.  More so than any other type, they have excellent people
skills.  They understand and care about people, and have a special talent
for bringing out the best in others.  ENFJ's main interest in life is giving
love, support, and a good time to other people.  They are 
focused on understanding, supporting, and encouraging others.
They make things happen for people, and get their best personal satisfaction
from this.
<p align="left">
Because ENFJ's people skills are so extraordinary, they have the ability to
make people do exactly what they want them to do.  They get under people's 
skins and get the reactions that they are seeking.  ENFJ's motives are usually
unselfish, but ENFJs who have developed less than ideally have been known to 
use their power over people to manipulate them.
<p>
ENFJ's are so externally focused that it's especially important for them
to spend time alone.  This can be difficult for some ENFJs, because they have
the tendency to be hard on themselves and turn to dark thoughts when alone.  
Consequently, ENFJs might avoid being alone, and fill their lives with 
activities involving other people.  ENFJs tend to define their life's direction
and priorities according to other people's needs, and may not be aware of 
their own needs.   It's natural to their personality type that they will tend
to place other people's needs above their own, but they need to stay aware
of their own needs so that they don't sacrifice themselves in their drive
to help others.
<p align="left">
ENFJ's tend to be more reserved about exposing themselves than other 
extraverted types.  Although they may have strongly-felt beliefs, they're
likely to refrain from expressing them if doing so would interfere with
bringing out the best in others. Because their strongest interest lies in being
a catalyst of change in other people, they're likely to interact with others
on their own level, in a chameleon-like manner, rather than as 
individuals.
<p align="left">
Which is not to say that the ENFJ does not have
opinions.  ENFJs have definite values and opinions which they're able
to express clearly and succinctly.  These beliefs will be expressed as long
as they're not too personal.  ENFJ is in many ways expressive and open,
but is more focused on being responsive and supportive of others.
When faced with a conflict between a
strongly-held value and serving another person's need, they are highly likely
to value the other person's needs.  
</p>


<p align="left">
The ENFJ may feel quite lonely even
when surrounded by people.  This feeling of aloneness may be
exacerbated by the tendency to not reveal their true selves.
<p align="left">
People love ENFJs.  They are fun to be with, and truly understand
and love people.  They are typically very straight-forward and honest.
Usually ENFJs exude a lot of self-confidence, and have a great amount of 
ability to do many different things.  They are generally bright,  full of
potential, energetic and fast-paced.  They are usually good at anything
which captures their interest.
<p align="left">
ENFJs like for things to be well-organized, and will work hard at
maintaining structure and resolving ambiguity.
They have a tendency to be fussy, especially with their
home environments.
<p align="left">
In the work place, ENFJs do well in positions where they deal with
people.  They are naturals for the social committee.  Their uncanny 
ability to understand people and say just what needs to be said to make
them happy makes them naturals for counseling.  They enjoy being the
center of attention, and do very well in situations where they can inspire
and lead others, such as teaching.
<p align="left">
ENFJs do not like dealing with impersonal reasoning.  They don't understand
or appreciate its merit, and will be unhappy in situations where they're forced
to deal with logic and facts without any connection to a human element.
Living in the world of people possibilities, they enjoy their plans
more than their achievements.  They get excited about possibilities for
the future, but may become easily bored and restless with the present.
<p align="left">
ENFJs have a special gift with people, and are basically happy people
when they can use that gift to help others.  They get their best satisfaction 
from serving others.  Their genuine interest in Humankind and their exceptional intuitive
awareness of people makes them able to draw out even the most reserved individuals.
<p align="left">
ENFJs have a strong need for close, intimate relationships, and will put forth a lot
of effort in creating and maintaining these relationships.  They're very loyal 
and trustworthy once involved in a relationship.
<p align="left">
An ENFJ who has not developed their Feeling side may have
difficulty making good decisions, and may rely heavily on
other people in decision-making processes.  If they have not developed their
Intuition,  they may not be able to see possibilities, and will judge things 
too quickly based
on established value systems or social rules, without really understanding the
current situation.  An ENFJ who has not found their place in the
world is likely to be extremely sensitive to criticism, and to have the
tendency to worry excessively and feel guilty.  They are also likely to be
very manipulative and controling with others.
<p align="left">
In general, ENFJs are charming, warm, gracious, creative and diverse individuals
with richly developed insights into what makes other people tick.  This special
ability to see growth potential in others combined with a genuine drive to
help people makes the ENFJ a truly valued individual.  As giving and caring as
the ENFJ is, they need to remember to value their own needs as well as the
needs of others.
