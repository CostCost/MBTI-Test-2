<H1 align="center"><i>The Protector</i></H1>
<P>
<p>
As an INFJ, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you
take things in primarily via intuition.  Your secondary mode is external, where
you deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit
with your personal value system.
<p>
INFJs are gentle, caring, complex and highly intuitive individuals.  Artistic
and creative, they live in a world of hidden meanings and possibilities.
Only one percent of the population has an INFJ Personality Type,
making it the most rare of all the types.
<p>
INFJs place great importance on havings things orderly and systematic in
their outer world.  They put a lot of energy into identifying the best
system for getting things done, and constantly define and re-define the
priorities in their lives.  On the other hand, INFJs operate within 
themselves on an intuitive basis which is entirely spontaneous.  They
know things intuitively, without being able to pinpoint why, and without
detailed knowledge of the subject at hand.  They are usually right, and
they usually know it.  Consequently, INFJs put a tremendous amount of faith
into their instincts and intuitions.  This is something of a conflict between
the inner and outer worlds, and may result in the INFJ not being as organized
as other Judging types tend to be.  Or we may see some signs of disarray in
an otherwise orderly tendency, such as a consistently messy desk.
<p>
INFJs have uncanny insight into people and situations.  They get "feelings" 
about things and intuitively understand them.  As an extreme example,
some INFJs report experiences of a psychic nature, such as getting strong
feelings about there being a problem with a loved one, and discovering later
that they were in a car accident.  This is the sort of thing that other types
may scorn and scoff at, and the INFJ themself does not really understand their
intuition at a level which can be verbalized.  Consequently, most INFJs are
protective of their inner selves, sharing only what they choose to share
when they choose to share it.  They are deep, complex individuals, who are
quite private and typically difficult to understand.  INFJs hold back part of 
themselves, and can be secretive.
<p>
But the INFJ is as genuinely warm as they are complex.  INFJs hold a special
place in the heart of people who they are close to, who are able to see
their special gifts and depth of caring.  INFJs are concerned for
people's feelings, and try to be gentle to avoid hurting anyone.  They are
very sensitive to conflict, and cannot tolerate it very well.  Situations
which are charged with conflict may drive the normally peaceful INFJ into
a state of agitation or charged anger.  They may tend to internalize conflict
into their bodies, and experience health problems when under a lot of stress.
<p>
Because the INFJ has such strong intuitive capabilities, they trust their
own instincts above all else.  This may result in an INFJ stubborness and 
tendency to ignore other people's opinions.  They believe that they're right.
On the other hand, INFJ is a perfectionist who doubts
that they are living up to their full potential.  INFJs are rarely at complete
peace with themselves - there's always something else they should be doing
to improve themselves and the world around them.  They believe in constant
growth, and don't often take time to revel in their accomplishments.
They have strong value systems, and need to live their lives in accordance 
with what they feel is right.  In deference to the Feeling aspect of
their personalities, INFJs are in some ways gentle and easy going.  Conversely,
they have very high expectations of themselves, and frequently of their
families.  They don't believe in compromising their ideals.
<p>
INFJ is a natural nurturer; patient, devoted and protective.  They make loving parents
and usually have strong bonds with their offspring.  They have high 
expectations of their children, and push them to be the best that they
can be.  This can sometimes manifest itself in the INFJ being hard-nosed
and stubborn. But generally, children of an INFJ get
devoted and sincere parental guidance, combined with deep caring.
<p>
In the workplace, the INFJ usually shows up in areas where they can be 
creative and somewhat independent.  They have a natural affinity for art, and
many excel in the sciences, where they make use of their intuition.
INFJs can also be found in service-oriented professions.
They are not good at dealing with minutia or very detailed tasks.  The
INFJ will either avoid such things, or else go to the other extreme and
become enveloped in the details to the extent that they can no longer see
the big picture.  An INFJ who has gone the route of becoming meticulous 
about details may be highly critical of other individuals who are not.
<p>
The INFJ individual is gifted in ways that other types are not.  Life is not
necessarily easy for the INFJ, but they are capable of great depth of
feeling and personal achievement.
